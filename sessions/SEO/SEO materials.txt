3- technical SEO :

*Search engines like Google and Bing use crawlers, sometimes also called bots or spiders, to gather information about all the content they can find on the internet.
 The crawler starts from a known web page and follows internal links to pages within that site as well as external links to pages on other sites.

*SEO attracts lots of high-quality user traffic

*At a page level, if you want search engines to index a URL, it generally needs to return a 200 HTTP response status code. 
 Obviously, you want to avoid 4xx and 5xx errors.
 A 3xx redirect code is less lethal, but it typically means the URL you're auditing isn't the one that's going to rank.

*Typically, your high-priority pages should be discoverable within 4–5 clicks of the homepage.
 This is part of your site architecture.
 You also want to avoid "orphaned pages" — which are pages not linked to by any internal URLs on your site.

*keep your URLs as simple as possible. Typically this means:
 Using shorter, human-readable URLs whenever possible
 Avoiding unnecessary parameters, such as session IDs or sorting parameters
 Broken relative links that cause "infinite spaces" (never-ending URLs)

*Content can be rendered with basic JavaScript

*Meta and structured data
 Your URL should contain a single title tag, with text describing your page.
 Web browsers typically display the title in the tab heading

*Title contains important keywords visible in first 60 characters

*The final check of your title tag is to make sure that it's not duplicated across your site

*Favicon defined
 <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/path/to/favicon.ico">

*Structured markup
 Whether it's as simple as article markup, identifying an author and/or an organization, product reviews, or even recipe markup

*recommend using headings to organize your content in a smart, logical way.
 Additionally, a single h1 is still recommended for accessibility, so it's a good idea if your headline follows this rule.

*Content isn't loaded in an iFrame
 In short, sometimes it's necessary or convenient to use iFrames, but you should avoid them whenever possible.

*Content doesn't violate Google's Quality Guidelines
 No sneaky redirects,Limit user-generated spam
 Popups and banners that get in the way of content are a common feature of websites, especially on mobile.
